Log of changes to DCSOps sites.

  PROD == production site (dcsops.org; runs at Heroku)
  STAG == staging site    (not yet set up as of 2017-11-22)

* [2018-01-05] PROD: master:20c2437

  Deployed pull requests #109, #131, and #132 for multiple patches
  bringing Heroku up to the tip of the master branch. Also updated the
  BOUNDARY_TABLE_ID config variable in Heroku to the updated Fusion
  Table ID mentioned in PR #131.

* [2017-12-28] PROD: master:cc3cd2c

  Deployed pull request #127 to update minor versions of multiple
  gems, bringing Heroku up to the tip of the master branch. Then
  merged the 'rails-update' branches of the two forked dependencies
  into their respective master branches and updated them in the Gemfile.

* [2017-12-26] PROD

  Multiple steps were taken to try and figure out why outages were
  occurring. The hourly rake task in Heroku Scheduler was disabled
  and then re-enabled, and the Periscope username was changed to the
  current value with "_NULL" added to invalidate the connection and
  then it was/will be changed back.

* [2017-11-29] PROD: master:2e4a871

  Deployed pull request #114 to reduce the number of lines logged
  during import.

* [2017-11-29] PROD

  Updated all database credentials with the command:

  $ heroku pg:credentials HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_BLACK --reset -a arcdata

  Substitute AQUA, JADE, and OLIVE for those databases respectively.
  The Heroku CLI gives a warning about how the '--reset' flag is being
  deprecated in favor of using 'heroku pg:credentials:rotate', but that
  'rotate' is only supported on Postgres 9.6.

  Created issue #122 to track updating Postgres. More information on
  rotating Heroku credentials is here: 
  https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql-credentials

* [2017-11-28] PROD: master:5076e49

  Deployed pull request #115 to include RCO ID in admin site results.

* [2017-11-28] PROD: master:2e6b8d4

  Tested a trivial deployment out with only documentation changes to
  make sure everything is working (related to issue #118). Brought 
  the Heroku production site to the tip of 'master'. Deployment is 
  managed through Heroku, and can be triggered with the command:

  $ git push heroku master

* [2017-11-15] PROD: master:24a773e3
  Todd Eichel brought the Heroku production site to commit 24a773e3
